          Material status from MM/PP view  
          Indicates whether the material may be used in the following areas:  
          Materials management  
          Production planning and control  
          Quality management  
          Plant maintenance  
          Warehouse management  
          Costing with a quantity structure  
          The material status restricts the usability of the material, that is, it defines whether a warning or an error message is displayed if you include the material in a particular function.  
          You can assign a material status to a material at the following levels:  
          Plant level  
          Cross-plant level (that is, at client level)  
          The material may be a part under development or one to be discontinued.

            UTC Time Stamp in Short Form (YYYYMMDDhhmmss)  
            The UTC time stamp is the date and time relative to UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).  
            To standardize local times in a UTC time stamp and thus make them comparable with other times, these local times need to be converted using your time zone and the ABAP command convert.  
            Even if the system is able to determine the time zone from Customizing or master data, you shoul save the time zone redundantly here.  
            The internal structure of the UTC time stamp is subdivided into a date part and a time part in packed number format <YYYYMMDDhhmmss>. You can also use the high resolution UTC time stamp (10^-7 seconds).

            The valid-from date of the material status is considered only if it precedes or is the same as the planning date; that is, if the valid-from date is later than the planning date, it is not considered, even if it is within the planning horizon.

                Planning date        Valid-from date          Time  
            In this case, the valid-from date is not considered in materials planning since it is later than the planning date.  
            Purchasing  
            The valid-from date of the material status is checked against the current date.  
            Example  
            You block the material for purchasing from May 1, xxxx. A purchase order is created for the material on April 28, xxxx with a delivery date of May 10, xxxx. In this case, the valid-from date May 1, xxxx is checked against the purchase order date April 28, xxxx and the purchase order is allowed. Had you created the purchase order on May 3, xxxx, an error message would have been issued.

            Date from Which the Plant-Specific Material Status Is Valid  
            Materials planning  
            The valid-from date of the material status is considered only if it precedes or is the same as the planning date; that is, if the valid-from date is later than the planning date, it is not considered, even if it is within the planning horizon.  
            Example  
                  I<-------------Planning horizon------------->I  
             -----I--------------------I-----------------------I-->  
                Planning date        Valid-from date          Time  
            In this case, the valid-from date is not considered in materials planning since it is later than the planning date.  
            Purchasing  
            The valid-from date of the material status is checked against the current date.  
            Example  
            You block the material for purchasing from May 1, xxxx. A purchase order is created for the material on April 28, xxxx with a delivery date of May 10, xxxx. In this case, the valid-from date May 1, xxxx is checked against the purchase order date April 28, xxxx and the purchase order is allowed. Had you created the purchase order on May 3, xxxx, an error message would have been issued.

            This indicator can be set in the material master record manually or, if batches are valuated individually, it is set automatically for the plants concerned, in which case it cannot be changed.  
            The indicator cannot be changed if stocks exist in either the current period or in the previous period. The reason for checking the previous period is because stocks can be posted to this period when goods movements are entered.

            Material: MRP profile  
            Key that you can use to store MRP parameters that are independent of the material master record.  
            In an MRP profile, you define  
            which fields are filled with values when MRP data is entered in the material master record,  
            which values these fields have,  
            which of these values can be overwritten and which not.  
            The information stored in a profile is standard information that is needed again and again in similar constellations when material master records are maintained. Thus the MRP profile is a useful entry aid and makes it easier to manage MRP data.

            Planning time fence  
            The planning time fence specifies a period within which no automatic changes are to be made to the master plan.  
            The planning time fence is maintained in workdays.  
            It is only used for materials that are planned using an MRP type which includes a firming type.  
            The firming type determines how order proposlas are to be created or scheduled within the planning time fence.

          title: Planning cycle
          description: |-
            Key that determines the day on which the material is planned and ordered.  
            The planning cycle is a planning calendar that is defined in Customizing for MRP.  
            In addition to the planning cycle, you can enter a delivery cycle which is defined in the planning calendar field.  
            It makes sense to enter a delivery cycle for the following situation:  
            You carry out the planning run and place orders every Monday and Tuesday. The materials that are ordered on Monday are delivered on Wednesday and the materials that are ordered on Tuesday are not delivered until Friday.  
            The system interprets an additionally specified planned delivery time as the minimum delivery time, which means that at least this number of days pass between the planning run or the order and delivery.  
            Before a material can be planned with the time-phased planning procedure, it must be assigned the MRP type that allows time-phased planning.

            You can activate fixed pegging for all products within a client by setting the Fixed Pegging indicator in the global settings.  
            You are able to activate fixed pegging specifically for only particular products. In this case, you set the indicator to 1 in the product master for the products.  
            However, you can also specifically exclude particular products from fixed pegging if you have activated fixed pegging at client level. To do this, set the indicator to 2 for the relevant products.

            The product is relevant to network alerts  
            If a product is relevant to network alerts, the system evaluates the direct alerts that it determines for this product for receipts or requirements at the superordinate levels of the pegging structure as well.  
            You can hide alerts for less critical components and thus:  
            Increase the clarity and transparency of the network alerts  
            Improve performance  
            If you choose the option  Do Not Determine Any Alerts, the system will not determine any direct alerts for the product. The product is thus also not relevant with regard to network alerts.

            Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling  
            To enable the scheduling of the goods receipt for Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling PP/DS, you must have specified a handling resource in the master data for the location.  
            Note  
            A day in PP/DS corresponds to 24 working hours. This means that if the handling resource is a time stream resource (single/multi-level resource), the resource has to be available 24 hours a day so that the goods receipt actually only takes one day. If the availability of the resource is less than 24 hours (for example, due to breaks), a goods receipt processing time lasting one day can be spread over several days.  
            Example  
            Transportation duration/production time: 3 days  
            Goods receipt processing time: 1 day  
            3 days + 1 day = 4 days -> The product is available on the fifth day.

            Alert threshold for early receipts  
            The system creates a date/time alert for a fixed or a dynamic pegging relationship if the earliness exceeds the alert threshold; that is, if the availability date/time is earlier than the specified timeframe before the requirements date.  
            You specify the timeframe in the format HHH.HHH:MM (hours:minutes). Example: 1.000:10 means 1000 hours and 10 minutes, 20:20 means 20 hours and 20 minutes.  
            If you do not specify a value, the system uses the value 100000:00. Therefore, the system only creates an alert if an availability date/time is more than 100,000 hours before the requirements date.  
            To enable the system to display the alerts, you must use an appropriate PP/DS alert profile in interactive planning.  
            To be able to see date/time alerts in dynamic pegging, the alert thresholds should be within the pegging interval.  
            You should note that the alert thresholds for earliness and lateness are used in the calculation of the days' supply.

            You should note that the alert thresholds for earliness and lateness are used in the calculation of the days' supply.  
            You can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) /SAPAPO/RRP_COVPARAM to influence the way in which the days' supply is calculated.

            Pegging strategy for dynamic pegging  
            Using the pegging strategy, you can determine in which time sequence the system should cover requirements for the product with dynamic pegging and in which time sequence the system should use the product receipts in the pegging interval to cover a requirement. Thus, the pegging strategy controls,  
            Which requirement the system should cover first  
            Which receipts the system should use first  
            Generally, for dynamic pegging, the system begins by covering the earliest requirement, and then processes the next requirement, and so on. Since there may be several receipts for the availability dates/times within the pegging interval, you must specify which receipt the system should use first. The following options exist:  
            Use current receipts  
            Here the system uses the current receipt where possible to cover a requirement. Starting from the requirement date the system first searches to the beginning of the pegging interval. If there are no receipts in this direction, the system will search to the end of the pegging interval.  
            Use the earliest receipt (First in first out)  
            Here the system uses the earliest receipts in the pegging interval to cover a requirement, that is, first the first receipt in the pegging interval and then the second, and so on. With this strategy, excess receipts only become available later.  
            In principle, only receipts and requirements from the same pegging area can be linked.

            Avoid Alerts in Pegging  
            If you set this indicator, the system attempts to create the pegging relationships between requirements and receipts if possible without quantity alerts or date alerts.  
            First, the system links receipts and requirements that are compatible on a time and quantity basis, then the remaining receipts and requirements in a second step.  
            This method can reduce performance.

            Requirement Strategy  
            Determines how quantities forecasted in Demand Planning are produced, and how the demand forecast is consumed with sales orders.  
            SAP delivers  the  requirements strategies listed below. You can also define your own strategies, see Define Requirements Strategy.  
            10   Make-to-stock production  
            Choose this strategy if sales orders do not influence production; for example, in a mass production environment where individual orders do not affect the amount produced. There is no consumption of the forecast by incoming sales orders.  
            20   Planning with final assembly  
            Choose this strategy if you can accurately forecast production quantities for the final product. With this make-to-stock strategy, production quantities take into account actual sales orders as well as forecasted demand: incoming sales orders consume the forecast, and production quantities result from the net demand. The advantage of this strategy is that you can react quickly to customer demand.  
            30   Planning w/o final assembly  
            Choose this strategy if the main value-added process is final assembly; that is, the amount of the sales order is fixed and production is unique for every customer. With this make-to-order strategy, only the product's component parts are produced prior to the taking of the sales order. The sales order consumes the forecast for the finished product and triggers production of the finished product.  
            35    Planning w/o final assembly for configurable products  
            This strategy is similar to requirement strategy 30 for non-configurable products. However, if you use strategy 35, the forecast data has a configuration of its own.  
            40   Planning product  
            Choose this strategy to plan non-variable parts for similar finished products and reserve the capacities that are required to produce them.  
            This strategy ensures a rapid response to customer demand and is particularly useful for products that have a long manufacturing lead time. The value-adding process is not carried out until the customer has placed their order. The planning product can be either a fictive entity that is never produced, or it can be a product that is actually produced.

            Key that determines the day on which the material is planned and ordered.  
            The planning cycle is a planning calendar that is defined in Customizing for MRP.  
            In addition to the planning cycle, you can enter a delivery cycle which is defined in the planning calendar field.  
            It makes sense to enter a delivery cycle for the following situation:  
            You carry out the planning run and place orders every Monday and Tuesday. The materials that are ordered on Monday are delivered on Wednesday and the materials that are ordered on Tuesday are not delivered until Friday.  
            The system interprets an additionally specified planned delivery time as the minimum delivery time, which means that at least this number of days pass between the planning run or the order and delivery.  
            Before a material can be planned with the time-phased planning procedure, it must be assigned the MRP type that allows time-phased planning.

            You use this indicator to retain fixed pegging for the product even after a document change (for example, after converting a planned order into a production order).  
            You can activate fixed pegging for all products within a client by setting the Fixed Pegging indicator in the global settings.  
            You are able to activate fixed pegging specifically for only particular products. In this case, you set the indicator to 1 in the product master for the products.  
            However, you can also specifically exclude particular products from fixed pegging if you have activated fixed pegging at client level. To do this, set the indicator to 2 for the relevant products.

            In this field, you specify whether:  
            The system determines direct alerts for a requirement or a receipt of a product  
            The product is relevant to network alerts  
            If a product is relevant to network alerts, the system evaluates the direct alerts that it determines for this product for receipts or requirements at the superordinate levels of the pegging structure as well.  
            You can hide alerts for less critical components and thus:  
            Increase the clarity and transparency of the network alerts  
            Improve performance  
            If you choose the option  Do Not Determine Any Alerts, the system will not determine any direct alerts for the product. The product is thus also not relevant with regard to network alerts.  
            You specify whether and which alerts are actually displayed by the system in the planning interface or in the Alert Monitor  in the PP/DS alert profile that you use for planning.

            The time between the delivery or the production of a product and its availability as stock. This time is used, for example, as handling time or time for quality checks, and is added to the transportation duration or the production time of a product.  
            Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling  
            To enable the scheduling of the goods receipt for Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling PP/DS, you must have specified a handling resource in the master data for the location.  
            Note  
            A day in PP/DS corresponds to 24 working hours. This means that if the handling resource is a time stream resource (single/multi-level resource), the resource has to be available 24 hours a day so that the goods receipt actually only takes one day. If the availability of the resource is less than 24 hours (for example, due to breaks), a goods receipt processing time lasting one day can be spread over several days.  
            Example  
            Transportation duration/production time: 3 days  
            Goods receipt processing time: 1 day  
            3 days + 1 day = 4 days -> The product is available on the fifth day.

            Alert threshold for early receipts  
            The system creates a date/time alert for a fixed or a dynamic pegging relationship if the earliness exceeds the alert threshold; that is, if the availability date/time is earlier than the specified timeframe before the requirements date.  
            You specify the timeframe in the format HHH.HHH:MM (hours:minutes). Example: 1.000:10 means 1000 hours and 10 minutes, 20:20 means 20 hours and 20 minutes.  
            If you do not specify a value, the system uses the value 100000:00. Therefore, the system only creates an alert if an availability date/time is more than 100,000 hours before the requirements date.  
            To enable the system to display the alerts, you must use an appropriate PP/DS alert profile in interactive planning.  
            To be able to see date/time alerts in dynamic pegging, the alert thresholds should be within the pegging interval.  
            You should note that the alert thresholds for earliness and lateness are used in the calculation of the days' supply.  
            You can use the Business Add-In (BAdI) /SAPAPO/RRP_COVPARAM to influence the way in which the days' supply is calculated.

            You specify the timeframe in the format HHH.HHH:MM (hours:minutes). Example: 1.000:10 means 1000 hours and 10 minutes, 20:20 means 20 hours and 20 minutes.  
            If you do not specify a value, the system uses the value 0. Therefore, the system creates an alert if the availability date/time is after the requirements date.

            Pegging strategy for dynamic pegging  
            Using the pegging strategy, you can determine in which time sequence the system should cover requirements for the product with dynamic pegging and in which time sequence the system should use the product receipts in the pegging interval to cover a requirement. Thus, the pegging strategy controls,  
            Which requirement the system should cover first  
            Which receipts the system should use first  
            Generally, for dynamic pegging, the system begins by covering the earliest requirement, and then processes the next requirement, and so on. Since there may be several receipts for the availability dates/times within the pegging interval, you must specify which receipt the system should use first. The following options exist:  
            Use current receipts  
            Here the system uses the current receipt where possible to cover a requirement. Starting from the requirement date the system first searches to the beginning of the pegging interval. If there are no receipts in this direction, the system will search to the end of the pegging interval.  
            Use the earliest receipt (First in first out)  
            Here the system uses the earliest receipts in the pegging interval to cover a requirement, that is, first the first receipt in the pegging interval and then the second, and so on. With this strategy, excess receipts only become available later.  
            In principle, only receipts and requirements from the same pegging area can be linked.

            Requirement Strategy  
            Determines how quantities forecasted in Demand Planning are produced, and how the demand forecast is consumed with sales orders.  
            SAP delivers  the  requirements strategies listed below. You can also define your own strategies, see Define Requirements Strategy.  
            10   Make-to-stock production  
            Choose this strategy if sales orders do not influence production; for example, in a mass production environment where individual orders do not affect the amount produced. There is no consumption of the forecast by incoming sales orders.  
            20   Planning with final assembly  
            Choose this strategy if you can accurately forecast production quantities for the final product. With this make-to-stock strategy, production quantities take into account actual sales orders as well as forecasted demand: incoming sales orders consume the forecast, and production quantities result from the net demand. The advantage of this strategy is that you can react quickly to customer demand.  
            30   Planning w/o final assembly  
            Choose this strategy if the main value-added process is final assembly; that is, the amount of the sales order is fixed and production is unique for every customer. With this make-to-order strategy, only the product's component parts are produced prior to the taking of the sales order. The sales order consumes the forecast for the finished product and triggers production of the finished product.  
            35    Planning w/o final assembly for configurable products  
            This strategy is similar to requirement strategy 30 for non-configurable products. However, if you use strategy 35, the forecast data has a configuration of its own.  
            40   Planning product  
            Choose this strategy to plan non-variable parts for similar finished products and reserve the capacities that are required to produce them.  
            This strategy ensures a rapid response to customer demand and is particularly useful for products that have a long manufacturing lead time. The value-adding process is not carried out until the customer has placed their order. The planning product can be either a fictive entity that is never produced, or it can be a product that is actually produced.

            Key that determines the day on which the material is planned and ordered.  
            The planning cycle is a planning calendar that is defined in Customizing for MRP.  
            In addition to the planning cycle, you can enter a delivery cycle which is defined in the planning calendar field.  
            It makes sense to enter a delivery cycle for the following situation:  
            You carry out the planning run and place orders every Monday and Tuesday. The materials that are ordered on Monday are delivered on Wednesday and the materials that are ordered on Tuesday are not delivered until Friday.  
            The system interprets an additionally specified planned delivery time as the minimum delivery time, which means that at least this number of days pass between the planning run or the order and delivery.  
            Before a material can be planned with the time-phased planning procedure, it must be assigned the MRP type that allows time-phased planning.

            Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling  
            To enable the scheduling of the goods receipt for Production Planning and Detailed Scheduling PP/DS, you must have specified a handling resource in the master data for the location.  
            Note  
            A day in PP/DS corresponds to 24 working hours. This means that if the handling resource is a time stream resource (single/multi-level resource), the resource has to be available 24 hours a day so that the goods receipt actually only takes one day. If the availability of the resource is less than 24 hours (for example, due to breaks), a goods receipt processing time lasting one day can be spread over several days.  
            Example  
            Transportation duration/production time: 3 days  
            Goods receipt processing time: 1 day  
            3 days + 1 day = 4 days -> The product is available on the fifth day.

            The system creates a date/time alert for a fixed or a dynamic pegging relationship if the earliness exceeds the alert threshold; that is, if the availability date/time is earlier than the specified timeframe before the requirements date.  
            You specify the timeframe in the format HHH.HHH:MM (hours:minutes). Example: 1.000:10 means 1000 hours and 10 minutes, 20:20 means 20 hours and 20 minutes.  
            If you do not specify a value, the system uses the value 100000:00. Therefore, the system only creates an alert if an availability date/time is more than 100,000 hours before the requirements date.  
            To enable the system to display the alerts, you must use an appropriate PP/DS alert profile in interactive planning.  
            To be able to see date/time alerts in dynamic pegging, the alert thresholds should be within the pegging interval.  
            You should note that the alert thresholds for earliness and lateness are used in the calculation of the days' supply.

            You specify the timeframe in the format HHH.HHH:MM (hours:minutes). Example: 1.000:10 means 1000 hours and 10 minutes, 20:20 means 20 hours and 20 minutes.

            Pegging strategy for dynamic pegging  
            Using the pegging strategy, you can determine in which time sequence the system should cover requirements for the product with dynamic pegging and in which time sequence the system should use the product receipts in the pegging interval to cover a requirement. Thus, the pegging strategy controls,  
            Which requirement the system should cover first  
            Which receipts the system should use first  
            Generally, for dynamic pegging, the system begins by covering the earliest requirement, and then processes the next requirement, and so on. Since there may be several receipts for the availability dates/times within the pegging interval, you must specify which receipt the system should use first. The following options exist:  
            Use current receipts  
            Here the system uses the current receipt where possible to cover a requirement. Starting from the requirement date the system first searches to the beginning of the pegging interval. If there are no receipts in this direction, the system will search to the end of the pegging interval.  
            Use the earliest receipt (First in first out)  
            Here the system uses the earliest receipts in the pegging interval to cover a requirement, that is, first the first receipt in the pegging interval and then the second, and so on. With this strategy, excess receipts only become available later.  
            In principle, only receipts and requirements from the same pegging area can be linked.

            Requirement Strategy  
            Determines how quantities forecasted in Demand Planning are produced, and how the demand forecast is consumed with sales orders.  
            SAP delivers  the  requirements strategies listed below. You can also define your own strategies, see Define Requirements Strategy.  
            10   Make-to-stock production  
            Choose this strategy if sales orders do not influence production; for example, in a mass production environment where individual orders do not affect the amount produced. There is no consumption of the forecast by incoming sales orders.  
            20   Planning with final assembly  
            Choose this strategy if you can accurately forecast production quantities for the final product. With this make-to-stock strategy, production quantities take into account actual sales orders as well as forecasted demand: incoming sales orders consume the forecast, and production quantities result from the net demand. The advantage of this strategy is that you can react quickly to customer demand.  
            30   Planning w/o final assembly  
            Choose this strategy if the main value-added process is final assembly; that is, the amount of the sales order is fixed and production is unique for every customer. With this make-to-order strategy, only the product's component parts are produced prior to the taking of the sales order. The sales order consumes the forecast for the finished product and triggers production of the finished product.  
            35    Planning w/o final assembly for configurable products  
            This strategy is similar to requirement strategy 30 for non-configurable products. However, if you use strategy 35, the forecast data has a configuration of its own.  
            40   Planning product  
            Choose this strategy to plan non-variable parts for similar finished products and reserve the capacities that are required to produce them.  
            This strategy ensures a rapid response to customer demand and is particularly useful for products that have a long manufacturing lead time. The value-adding process is not carried out until the customer has placed their order. The planning product can be either a fictive entity that is never produced, or it can be a product that is actually produced.

            The batches can be determined when the goods issue is posted.  
            The batches must be entered in the order before it is released.  
            The batches must be entered in the order before the goods issue is posted, but not necessarily before the order is released.  
            If you use pick parts, the batches are determined in the transfer order and then confirmed to the order. If there is no direct link between the transfer order and the production order/process order (for example, with release order parts or crate parts), you must enter the batches in the production order/process order manually.  
            The batches are determined automatically when the order is released.

          title: Backflush
          description: |-
            Indicator: Backflush  
            Determines whether the backflush indicator is set in the production order. Here, a 3-level hierarchy logic is applied:  
            In the routing, the backflush indicator is set in the component assignment.  
            In the material master record, the backflush indicator is set to "Always Backflush".  
            In the material master record, the backflush indicator is set to "Work Center Decides", and the indicator is set in the work center.  
            Each material component is assigned to an operation in the production order. If a material component is backflushed, the system posts the withdrawal only upon confirmation of the operation. The withdrawal is then posted automatically.
        BulkMaterial:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          title: Bulk material
          description: |-
            Indicator: bulk material  
            This indicator defines a BOM item as a bulk material, which is available directly at the work center (for example, washers or grease).  
            The dependent requirements of bulk materials are not relevant to materials planning. This means they are not taken into account for net requirements calculation. Therefore planning for bulk materials should be consumption-based.  
            If bulk materials are subject to material requirements planning, you must create planned independent requirements for them.  
            Dependent requirements are only created in the planned order for information purposes and they can be displayed there. Dependent requirements for bulk material are not shown in the MRP list or the stock/req. list.  
            You can maintain this indicator in both the material master record an the BOM item. The indicator in the material master record has higher priority.  
            If a material is always used as a bulk material, set the indicator in the material master record.  
            In this case, the Bulk material indicator in material master record is automatically set in the BOM item.  
            If a material is only used as a bulk material in individual cases, set the indicator in the BOM item.  
            To improve system performance, you can define in the IMG for MRP that no dependent requirements are to be created for bulk material items. However, this also means that you see no information on bulk material components in the planned order or production order.
        SpecProcurement:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 2

          description: |-
            Special procurement type  
            Allows you to define the procurement type more exactly. The system determines the procurement type from the material type.  
            You use special procurement when you want to be able to override the procurement type in the material master or define the procurement type more precisely.  
            If the procurement type is in-house, you can nevertheless force the system to ignore the BOM and routing, and process the material as if it were externally procured, by specifying the special procurement as external.  
            Enter the special procurement type to which you want to restrict the selection.  
            If you procure a material externally, you may want to choose the special procurement type Consignment. If you produce the material in-house, it may be appropriate to choose Production in other plant.  
            If a material has a routing but no BOM, it is treated as an externally procured material even if the procurement type is in-house. Both the BOM and the routing are ignored.  
            However, if you specify the special procurement type as in-house, the routing is included even if the material has no BOM.

            purchase orders  
            The quantity of the material already ordered is included in the quota arrangement.  
            purchase requisitions  
            The total quantity requested in purchase requisitions for this material is included in the quota arrangement.  
            scheduling agreement

            The proposed supply area is used, for example, to determine the supply area for the dependent requirements of a material.  
            The supply area in the dependent requirements of a material is required:

            Determines whether the backflush indicator is set in the production order. Here, a 3-level hierarchy logic is applied:  
            In the routing, the backflush indicator is set in the component assignment.  
            In the material master record, the backflush indicator is set to "Always Backflush".  
            In the material master record, the backflush indicator is set to "Work Center Decides", and the indicator is set in the work center.  
            Each material component is assigned to an operation in the production order. If a material component is backflushed, the system posts the withdrawal only upon confirmation of the operation. The withdrawal is then posted automatically.

            Indicator: bulk material  
            This indicator defines a BOM item as a bulk material, which is available directly at the work center (for example, washers or grease).  
            The dependent requirements of bulk materials are not relevant to materials planning. This means they are not taken into account for net requirements calculation. Therefore planning for bulk materials should be consumption-based.  
            If bulk materials are subject to material requirements planning, you must create planned independent requirements for them.  
            Dependent requirements are only created in the planned order for information purposes and they can be displayed there. Dependent requirements for bulk material are not shown in the MRP list or the stock/req. list.  
            You can maintain this indicator in both the material master record an the BOM item. The indicator in the material master record has higher priority.  
            If a material is always used as a bulk material, set the indicator in the material master record.  
            In this case, the Bulk material indicator in material master record is automatically set in the BOM item.  
            If a material is only used as a bulk material in individual cases, set the indicator in the BOM item.  
            To improve system performance, you can define in the IMG for MRP that no dependent requirements are to be created for bulk material items. However, this also means that you see no information on bulk material components in the planned order or production order.

            If the procurement type is in-house, you can nevertheless force the system to ignore the BOM and routing, and process the material as if it were externally procured, by specifying the special procurement as external.  
            Enter the special procurement type to which you want to restrict the selection.  
            If you procure a material externally, you may want to choose the special procurement type Consignment. If you produce the material in-house, it may be appropriate to choose Production in other plant.  
            If a material has a routing but no BOM, it is treated as an externally procured material even if the procurement type is in-house. Both the BOM and the routing are ignored.  
            However, if you specify the special procurement type as in-house, the routing is included even if the material has no BOM.

            The proposed supply area is mainly used for KANBAN materials that are only or usually provided at one supply area in a plant. Here, this supply area can be easily saved in the system.  
            The proposed supply area is used, for example, to determine the supply area for the dependent requirements of a material.  
            The supply area in the dependent requirements of a material is required:  
            to enable the system to calculate the KANBAN control cycles automatically  
            to enable you to select requirements in the pull list with reference to a supply area

            Future planned price  
            Price from a marked standard cost estimate.  
            If you create and mark a standard cost estimate for the material, the results of this cost estimate are copied to this field.  
            If you later release the standard cost estimate for this material, the price entered here is updated as the current planned price and as the current standard price.  
            If you do not release the marked standard cost estimate, but create a new one for the material, you can remark the results. You can keep remarking the results until you release the cost estimate.  
            Note  
            If no marked standard cost estimate exists, you can enter a price in this field manually. This makes it possible for the system to find a price when costing an assembly via the valuation strategy, even if no standard cost estimate with status KA (correct) exists for a BOM material (such as a raw material or semifinished product).  
            If you subsequently create and flag a cost estimate for this material, the results of this cost estimate are adopted as the future planned price, and the manual entry overwritten. It can then no longer be changed. Therefore, you are recommended to use the Planned price 1, Planned price 2, and Planned price 3 fields to maintain the planned prices of material components and to define them in the valuation strategy.

            Material Price Determination: Control  
            You have the following options:  
            In Transaction-Based material price determination (option 2 in the material master), with price control V the material is valued at the moving average price. With price control S, the material is valued at the standard price. The moving average price is calculated for information purposes.  
            In Single-/Multilevel price determination (option 3 in the material master), the valuation price (standard price) remains unchanged and a periodic unit price is calculated for the material valuation of the closed period.  
            This option is only possible for materials with price control S (standard price), and is only recommended if, in addition to multiple currencies and/or valuations, you use Single-/Multilevel material price determination.  
            With Single-/Multilevel material price determination, a periodic unit price is updated for information purposes but can only be used for material valuation in the closed period.  
            The indicator is only relevant if the material ledger is active.  
            When you activate the material ledger for a valuation area in Customizing, you can specify what type of material price determination will be proposed when a material is created in that valuation area. This proposal will be ignored at production startup: the system automatically sets the indicator to 2 in the material master for all materials present.  
            If you want to change the indicator for a particular material later, go to the SAP Easy Access menu and choose Accounting > Controlling > Product Cost Controlling > Actual Costing/Material Ledger > Environment > Change Material Price Determination.

            Moving average price  
            Periodic unit price (only if the material ledger is activated for the material)  
            The system calculates the moving average price automatically by dividing the material value in the stock account by the total of all storage location stocks in the plant concerned. It changes the price with each valuation-relevant movement.  
            The system changes the periodic unit price if you settle the material ledger and then save the data.  
            The valuation of stocks at moving average price or periodic unit price means that the price of the material is adapted to the continual fluctuations in the procurement price.  
            If the material ledger is activated for the material, the material's settlement control determines whether this price is the moving average price or the periodic unit price.

            Future planned price  
            Price from a marked standard cost estimate.  
            If you create and mark a standard cost estimate for the material, the results of this cost estimate are copied to this field.  
            If you later release the standard cost estimate for this material, the price entered here is updated as the current planned price and as the current standard price.  
            If you do not release the marked standard cost estimate, but create a new one for the material, you can remark the results. You can keep remarking the results until you release the cost estimate.  
            Note  
            If no marked standard cost estimate exists, you can enter a price in this field manually. This makes it possible for the system to find a price when costing an assembly via the valuation strategy, even if no standard cost estimate with status KA (correct) exists for a BOM material (such as a raw material or semifinished product).  
            If you subsequently create and flag a cost estimate for this material, the results of this cost estimate are adopted as the future planned price, and the manual entry overwritten. It can then no longer be changed. Therefore, you are recommended to use the Planned price 1, Planned price 2, and Planned price 3 fields to maintain the planned prices of material components and to define them in the valuation strategy.

            Material Price Determination: Control  
            You have the following options:  
            In Transaction-Based material price determination (option 2 in the material master), with price control V the material is valued at the moving average price. With price control S, the material is valued at the standard price. The moving average price is calculated for information purposes.  
            In Single-/Multilevel price determination (option 3 in the material master), the valuation price (standard price) remains unchanged and a periodic unit price is calculated for the material valuation of the closed period.  
            This option is only possible for materials with price control S (standard price), and is only recommended if, in addition to multiple currencies and/or valuations, you use Single-/Multilevel material price determination.  
            With Single-/Multilevel material price determination, a periodic unit price is updated for information purposes but can only be used for material valuation in the closed period.  
            The indicator is only relevant if the material ledger is active.  
            When you activate the material ledger for a valuation area in Customizing, you can specify what type of material price determination will be proposed when a material is created in that valuation area. This proposal will be ignored at production startup: the system automatically sets the indicator to 2 in the material master for all materials present.  
            If you want to change the indicator for a particular material later, go to the SAP Easy Access menu and choose Accounting > Controlling > Product Cost Controlling > Actual Costing/Material Ledger > Environment > Change Material Price Determination.

            Moving Average Price/Periodic Unit Price  
            Price of the material. This can be one of the following:  
            Moving average price  
            Periodic unit price (only if the material ledger is activated for the material)  
            The system calculates the moving average price automatically by dividing the material value in the stock account by the total of all storage location stocks in the plant concerned. It changes the price with each valuation-relevant movement.  
            The system changes the periodic unit price if you settle the material ledger and then save the data.  
            The valuation of stocks at moving average price or periodic unit price means that the price of the material is adapted to the continual fluctuations in the procurement price.  
            If the material ledger is activated for the material, the material's settlement control determines whether this price is the moving average price or the periodic unit price.

            If you do not release the marked standard cost estimate, but create a new one for the material, you can remark the results. You can keep remarking the results until you release the cost estimate.  
            Note  
            If no marked standard cost estimate exists, you can enter a price in this field manually. This makes it possible for the system to find a price when costing an assembly via the valuation strategy, even if no standard cost estimate with status KA (correct) exists for a BOM material (such as a raw material or semifinished product).  
            If you subsequently create and flag a cost estimate for this material, the results of this cost estimate are adopted as the future planned price, and the manual entry overwritten. It can then no longer be changed. Therefore, you are recommended to use the Planned price 1, Planned price 2, and Planned price 3 fields to maintain the planned prices of material components and to define them in the valuation strategy.

            Material Price Determination: Control  
            You have the following options:  
            In Transaction-Based material price determination (option 2 in the material master), with price control V the material is valued at the moving average price. With price control S, the material is valued at the standard price. The moving average price is calculated for information purposes.  
            In Single-/Multilevel price determination (option 3 in the material master), the valuation price (standard price) remains unchanged and a periodic unit price is calculated for the material valuation of the closed period.  
            This option is only possible for materials with price control S (standard price), and is only recommended if, in addition to multiple currencies and/or valuations, you use Single-/Multilevel material price determination.  
            With Single-/Multilevel material price determination, a periodic unit price is updated for information purposes but can only be used for material valuation in the closed period.  
            The indicator is only relevant if the material ledger is active.  
            When you activate the material ledger for a valuation area in Customizing, you can specify what type of material price determination will be proposed when a material is created in that valuation area. This proposal will be ignored at production startup: the system automatically sets the indicator to 2 in the material master for all materials present.  
            If you want to change the indicator for a particular material later, go to the SAP Easy Access menu and choose Accounting > Controlling > Product Cost Controlling > Actual Costing/Material Ledger > Environment > Change Material Price Determination.

            Moving Average Price/Periodic Unit Price  
            Price of the material. This can be one of the following:  
            Moving average price  
            Periodic unit price (only if the material ledger is activated for the material)  
            The system calculates the moving average price automatically by dividing the material value in the stock account by the total of all storage location stocks in the plant concerned. It changes the price with each valuation-relevant movement.  
            The system changes the periodic unit price if you settle the material ledger and then save the data.  
            The valuation of stocks at moving average price or periodic unit price means that the price of the material is adapted to the continual fluctuations in the procurement price.  
            If the material ledger is activated for the material, the material's settlement control determines whether this price is the moving average price or the periodic unit price.

            Denominator for conversion to base units of measure  
            Denominator of the quotient that specifies the ratio of the alternative unit of measure to the base unit of measure.  
            To convert a quantity, whose unit of measure is not the same as the base unit of measure, into the base unit of measure, the system requires a quotient:  
            Quantity (in alternative unit of measure) = quotient * quantity (in base unit of measure)  
            Enter the number of units of the alternative unit of measure (denominator) that corresponds to the number of units of the base unit of measure (numerator).  
            The alternative unit of measure is kilogram (kg). The base unit of measure is piece (PC). 5 kg correspond to 3 pieces.  
            5 kg = 3 PC   =>   1 kg = 3/5 PC  
            In this case, the quotient is therefore 3/5 (the numerator being 3 and the denominator 5).  
            You may enter only whole numbers in the numerator and denominator fields; that is, if 3.14 m² correspond to one piece, you must enter integer multiples (314 m² = 100 PC). In this case, the quotient is therefore 100/314 (the numerator being 100 and the denominator 314).

            Denominator for conversion to base units of measure  
            Denominator of the quotient that specifies the ratio of the alternative unit of measure to the base unit of measure.  
            To convert a quantity, whose unit of measure is not the same as the base unit of measure, into the base unit of measure, the system requires a quotient:  
            Quantity (in alternative unit of measure) = quotient * quantity (in base unit of measure)  
            Enter the number of units of the alternative unit of measure (denominator) that corresponds to the number of units of the base unit of measure (numerator).  
            The alternative unit of measure is kilogram (kg). The base unit of measure is piece (PC). 5 kg correspond to 3 pieces.  
            5 kg = 3 PC   =>   1 kg = 3/5 PC  
            In this case, the quotient is therefore 3/5 (the numerator being 3 and the denominator 5).  
            You may enter only whole numbers in the numerator and denominator fields; that is, if 3.14 m² correspond to one piece, you must enter integer multiples (314 m² = 100 PC). In this case, the quotient is therefore 100/314 (the numerator being 100 and the denominator 314).

            The alternative unit of measure is kilogram (kg). The base unit of measure is piece (PC). 5 kg correspond to 3 pieces.  
            5 kg = 3 PC   =>   1 kg = 3/5 PC  
            In this case, the quotient is therefore 3/5 (the numerator being 3 and the denominator 5).  
            You may enter only whole numbers in the numerator and denominator fields; that is, if 3.14 m² correspond to one piece, you must enter integer multiples (314 m² = 100 PC). In this case, the quotient is therefore 100/314 (the numerator being 100 and the denominator 314).

            Numerator for Conversion to Base Units of Measure  
            Numerator of the quotient that specifies the ratio of the alternative unit of measure to the base unit of measure.  
            To convert a quantity, whose unit of measure is not the same as the base unit of measure, into the base unit of measure, the system requires a quotient:  
            Quantity (in alternative unit of measure) = quotient * quantity (in base unit of measure)  
            Enter the number of units of the alternative unit of measure (denominator) that corresponds to the number of units of the base unit of measure (numerator).  
            The alternative unit of measure is kilogram (kg). The base unit of measure is piece (PC). 5 kg correspond to 3 pieces.  
            5 kg = 3 PC   =>   1 kg = 3/5 PC  
            In this case, the quotient is therefore 3/5 (the numerator being 3 and the denominator 5).  
            You may enter only whole numbers in the numerator and denominator fields; that is, if 3.14 m² correspond to one piece, you must enter integer multiples (314 m² = 100 PC). In this case, the quotient is therefore 100/314 (the numerator being 100 and the denominator 314).

            Product allocation determination procedure  
            The product allocation determination procedure determines how product allocation is carried out.  
            The product allocation determination procedure should be entered in the basic data screen in the material master record.  
            Certain allocations to the product allocation determination procedure strongly influence how product allocations can be created with the application menu:  
            You assign an info structure to the product allocation determination procedure. This info structure influences which criteria are used when product allocations are stored in the planning hierarchy.  
            You can assign several objects to the product allocation determination procedure. Each object has its own validity period. On the basis of the delivery date in the order, the system determines the relevant object. The system then uses this object to determine the corresponding planning hierarchy which contains product allocations.

            If you set the indicator, the following applies:  
            If you only use date validity, you can override the date that the system uses to determine the components. To do this, you set certain change numbers as valid or invalid.  
            If you use parameter effectivity, you can assign values to the effectivity parameters. As well as this you can set certain change numbers to valid or invalid and thus override the parameter variant (the values you previously assigned).

            If this indicator is set, you can assign a variant class to the material, making it possible to use it as a configurable material.  
            This indicator can be set in one of the following ways:  
            Manually in the material master record, irrespective of the material type  
            In Customizing for the Material Master in the activity Define Attributes of Material Types  
            In this case, the indicator is set automatically whenever you create a material of the corresponding material type. It is not possible to cancel the indicator manually in the material master record.

            Specifies that this is an environmentally relevant material.  
            When you save a delivery in the SAP component Sales and Distribution (SD), the system checks whether the delivery contains a material for which the Environmentally relevant indicator is set. If it does, an output of output type SDB is selected via an SD condition schema. The output selected is used to forward the data for the delivery (material, recipient, sales organization, and so on) to the Product Safety component, where additional checks and functions are triggered.  
            A report is shipped automatically if  
            the environmentally relevant material is assigned to a substance  
            this substance is subject to a material safety data sheet in the jurisdiction to which the recipient is in turn subject  
            Customizing for Product Safety is configured accordingly under Report Shipping and the system can select a suitable report.

            Unit in which the dimensions of length, breadth, and height of a material or its packaging are measured.
        Medium:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 6
          title: Medium
          description: |-
            The medium that is transferred through the link between the two technical objects  
            Two pumps, created in the system as pieces of equipment, are linked with each other by means of the piece of equipment "Pipe". The pumps supply water through the pipe, and therefore the medium in this case is water.
        BaseUnit:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 3
          title: Base Unit
          description: |-
            Base Unit of Measure  
            Unit of measure in which stocks of the material are managed. The system converts all the quantities you enter in other units of measure (alternative units of measure) to the base unit of measure.  
            You define the base unit of measure and also alternative units of measure and their conversion factors in the material master record.  
            Since all data is updated in the base unit of measure, your entry is particularly important for the conversion of alternative units of measure. A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:  
            The base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.  
            The conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).  
            Inventory Management  
            In Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.  
            Services  
            Services have units of measure of their own, including the following:  
            Service unit  
            Unit of measure at the higher item level. The precise quantities of the individual services are each at the detailed service line level.  
            Blanket  
            Unit of measure at service line level for services to be provided once only, and for which no precise quantities can or are to be specified.
        XPlantStatus:
          type: string
          nullable: true

          title: X-Plant Status
          description: |-
            Cross-Plant Material Status  
            Indicates whether the material may be used in the following areas for all plants:  
            Materials management (for example, in purchasing and in inventory management)  
            Production planning and control  
            Plant maintenance  
            Warehouse management  
            Costing with a quantity structure  
            The cross-plant material status restricts the usability of the material for all plants, that is, it defines whether a warning or error message is displayed if you include the material in a particular function.  
            The material may be a part under development or one to be discontinued.
        ValidFrom:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          format: date-time
          example: '2017-04-13T15:51:04Z'
          title: Valid from
          description: |-
            Date from which the cross-plant material status is valid  
            Materials planning  
            The valid-from date of the material status is considered only if it precedes or is the same as the planning date; that is, if the valid-from date is later than the planning date, it is not considered, even if it is within the planning horizon.  
            Example  
                  I<-------------Planning horizon------------->I  
             -----I--------------------I-----------------------I-->  
                Planning date        Valid-from date          Time  
            In this case, the valid-from date is not considered in materials planning since it is later than the planning date.  
            Purchasing  
            The valid-from date of the material status is checked against the current date.  
            Example  
            You block the material for purchasing from May 1, xxxx. A purchase order is created for the material on April 28, xxxx with a delivery date of May 10, xxxx. In this case, the valid-from date May 1, xxxx is checked against the purchase order date April 28, xxxx and the purchase order is allowed. Had you created the purchase order on May 3, xxxx, an error message would have been issued.
        MaterialType:

        GenItemCatGroup:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 4
          title: GenItemCatGroup
          description: |-
            General item category group  
            Materials grouping that helps the system to determine item categories during sales document processing.  
            If a group is configured specific to distribution channel, it has priority if the corresponding activity is distribution channel-dependent.  
            The system automatically suggests an item type in the document depending on the item category group you assign and the sales document type you are processing.  
            In the standard system, there are normal items, items that signify services (and therefore need no delivery processing) and items that signify packing material, for example.

            Dangerous Goods Indicator Profile  
            Alphanumeric key that uniquely identifies the dangerous goods profile.  
            You use dangerous goods indicator profiles to control applications for dangerous goods.  
            A dangerous goods indicator profile for the material master consists of a combination of indicators, for example:  
            Relevant for dangerous goods  
            Execute dangerous goods check  
            Output dangerous goods documents
        RefMatPack:

          title: Ref. mat. for pckg
          description: |-
            Reference material for materials packed in same way  
            Material master record that serves as a template for packing with packing instructions for materials that can be packed in the same way.  
            The material, for which the reference material is entered in the material master record, can be packed with special packing instructions for the reference material.  
            There must be a material master record for the reference material.  
            The materials 4711-01 and 4711-02 can be packed in the same way. For both materials, the reference material 4711 is entered in the material master record.  
            If you now create a packing instruction containing the reference material 4711 as an item of item type "R", both material 4711-01 and material 4711-02 can be packed automatically using this packing instruction.
        CrossPlantCM:

            Cross-Plant Configurable Material  
            Alphanumeric key uniquely identifying the configurable material.  
            Unlike the plant-specific configurable material, the cross-plant configurable material is valid for all plants.
        Serial:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 4

          title: SerializLevel
          description: |-
            Level of Explicitness for Serial Number  
            Level on which the serial number must be unique.  
            If the indicator is blank, then only the combination of the material- and serial number is unique.  
            If the indicator is 1, the serial number and equipment number are kept synchronous; that is, when master records are created, the system always sets the equipment number the same as the serial number.  
            In this way you can make the serial numbers unique on a client-wide scale. A prerequisite for this is that all material master records have the indicator set to 1.  
            This indicator is plant wide, that is, the setting applies to all the plants of the corresponding material master record.
        Division:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 2
          title: Division
          description: |-
            A way of grouping materials, products, or services. The system uses divisions to determine the sales areas and the business areas for a material, product, or service.  
            A product or service is always assigned to just one division. From the point of view of sales and distribution, the use of divisions lets you organize your sales structure around groups of similar products or product lines. This allows the people in a division who process orders and service customers to specialize within a manageable area of expertise.  
            If a sales organization sells food and non-food products through both retail and wholesaledistribution channels each distribution channel could then be further split into food and non-food divisions.

          description: |-
            Batch management requirement indicator  
            Specifies whether the material is managed in batches.  
            This indicator can be set in the material master record manually or, if batches are valuated individually, it is set automatically for the plants concerned, in which case it cannot be changed.  
            The indicator cannot be changed if stocks exist in either the current period or in the previous period. The reason for checking the previous period is because stocks can be posted to this period when goods movements are entered.
        BatchRecReq:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          title: Batch rec. req.
          description: |-
            Approved Batch Record Required  
            You use this indicator to specify that the following activities may only be performed after the relevant batch record has been approved:  
            Making the usage decision for an inspection lot of the origin Goods receipt from production  
            Changing the batch status from Restricted to Unrestricted  
            This indicator is only taken into account for batches that have been manufactured using a process order.  
            We recommend using an order type for which the Batch record required indicator has been set in Customizing to produce materials for which this indicator has been set.
        DocumentType:

            Product allocation determination procedure  
            The product allocation determination procedure determines how product allocation is carried out.  
            The product allocation determination procedure should be entered in the basic data screen in the material master record.  
            Certain allocations to the product allocation determination procedure strongly influence how product allocations can be created with the application menu:  
            You assign an info structure to the product allocation determination procedure. This info structure influences which criteria are used when product allocations are stored in the planning hierarchy.  
            You can assign several objects to the product allocation determination procedure. Each object has its own validity period. On the basis of the delivery date in the order, the system determines the relevant object. The system then uses this object to determine the corresponding planning hierarchy which contains product allocations.
        AssignEffVals:

            Assign effectivity parameter values/ override change numbers  
            Indicates whether you can assign values to the effectivity parameters or override the date, when you explode an assembly or a finished product.  
            If you set the indicator, the following applies:  
            If you only use date validity, you can override the date that the system uses to determine the components. To do this, you set certain change numbers as valid or invalid.  
            If you use parameter effectivity, you can assign values to the effectivity parameters. As well as this you can set certain change numbers to valid or invalid and thus override the parameter variant (the values you previously assigned).
        Configurable:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          title: Configurable
          description: |-
            Configurable Material  
            Indicator that determines whether the material is configurable.  
            If this indicator is set, you can assign a variant class to the material, making it possible to use it as a configurable material.  
            This indicator can be set in one of the following ways:  
            Manually in the material master record, irrespective of the material type  
            In Customizing for the Material Master in the activity Define Attributes of Material Types  
            In this case, the indicator is set automatically whenever you create a material of the corresponding material type. It is not possible to cancel the indicator manually in the material master record.

            Environmentally Relevant  
            Specifies that this is an environmentally relevant material.  
            When you save a delivery in the SAP component Sales and Distribution (SD), the system checks whether the delivery contains a material for which the Environmentally relevant indicator is set. If it does, an output of output type SDB is selected via an SD condition schema. The output selected is used to forward the data for the delivery (material, recipient, sales organization, and so on) to the Product Safety component, where additional checks and functions are triggered.  
            A report is shipped automatically if  
            the environmentally relevant material is assigned to a substance  
            this substance is subject to a material safety data sheet in the jurisdiction to which the recipient is in turn subject  
            Customizing for Product Safety is configured accordingly under Report Shipping and the system can select a suitable report.

          title: Base Unit
          description: |-
            Base Unit of Measure  
            Unit of measure in which stocks of the material are managed. The system converts all the quantities you enter in other units of measure (alternative units of measure) to the base unit of measure.  
            You define the base unit of measure and also alternative units of measure and their conversion factors in the material master record.  
            Since all data is updated in the base unit of measure, your entry is particularly important for the conversion of alternative units of measure. A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:  
            The base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.  
            The conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).  
            Inventory Management  
            In Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.  
            Services  
            Services have units of measure of their own, including the following:  
            Service unit  
            Unit of measure at the higher item level. The precise quantities of the individual services are each at the detailed service line level.  
            Blanket

            Materials management (for example, in purchasing and in inventory management)  
            Production planning and control  
            Plant maintenance  
            Warehouse management  
            Costing with a quantity structure  
            The cross-plant material status restricts the usability of the material for all plants, that is, it defines whether a warning or error message is displayed if you include the material in a particular function.  
            The material may be a part under development or one to be discontinued.
        ValidFrom:

          description: |-
            Date from which the cross-plant material status is valid  
            Materials planning  
            The valid-from date of the material status is considered only if it precedes or is the same as the planning date; that is, if the valid-from date is later than the planning date, it is not considered, even if it is within the planning horizon.  
            Example  
                  I<-------------Planning horizon------------->I  
             -----I--------------------I-----------------------I-->  
                Planning date        Valid-from date          Time  
            In this case, the valid-from date is not considered in materials planning since it is later than the planning date.  
            Purchasing  
            The valid-from date of the material status is checked against the current date.  
            Example  
            You block the material for purchasing from May 1, xxxx. A purchase order is created for the material on April 28, xxxx with a delivery date of May 10, xxxx. In this case, the valid-from date May 1, xxxx is checked against the purchase order date April 28, xxxx and the purchase order is allowed. Had you created the purchase order on May 3, xxxx, an error message would have been issued.

            General item category group  
            Materials grouping that helps the system to determine item categories during sales document processing.  
            If a group is configured specific to distribution channel, it has priority if the corresponding activity is distribution channel-dependent.  
            The system automatically suggests an item type in the document depending on the item category group you assign and the sales document type you are processing.  
            In the standard system, there are normal items, items that signify services (and therefore need no delivery processing) and items that signify packing material, for example.

            Dangerous Goods Indicator Profile  
            Alphanumeric key that uniquely identifies the dangerous goods profile.  
            You use dangerous goods indicator profiles to control applications for dangerous goods.  
            A dangerous goods indicator profile for the material master consists of a combination of indicators, for example:  
            Relevant for dangerous goods  
            Execute dangerous goods check  
            Output dangerous goods documents
        RefMatPack:

          title: Ref. mat. for pckg
          description: |-
            Reference material for materials packed in same way  
            Material master record that serves as a template for packing with packing instructions for materials that can be packed in the same way.  
            The material, for which the reference material is entered in the material master record, can be packed with special packing instructions for the reference material.  
            There must be a material master record for the reference material.  
            The materials 4711-01 and 4711-02 can be packed in the same way. For both materials, the reference material 4711 is entered in the material master record.  
            If you now create a packing instruction containing the reference material 4711 as an item of item type "R", both material 4711-01 and material 4711-02 can be packed automatically using this packing instruction.
        CrossPlantCM:

          nullable: true
          maxLength: 1
          title: SerializLevel
          description: |-
            Level of Explicitness for Serial Number  
            Level on which the serial number must be unique.  
            If the indicator is blank, then only the combination of the material- and serial number is unique.  
            If the indicator is 1, the serial number and equipment number are kept synchronous; that is, when master records are created, the system always sets the equipment number the same as the serial number.  
            In this way you can make the serial numbers unique on a client-wide scale. A prerequisite for this is that all material master records have the indicator set to 1.  
            This indicator is plant wide, that is, the setting applies to all the plants of the corresponding material master record.
        Division:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 2
          title: Division
          description: |-
            A way of grouping materials, products, or services. The system uses divisions to determine the sales areas and the business areas for a material, product, or service.  
            A product or service is always assigned to just one division. From the point of view of sales and distribution, the use of divisions lets you organize your sales structure around groups of similar products or product lines. This allows the people in a division who process orders and service customers to specialize within a manageable area of expertise.  
            If a sales organization sells food and non-food products through both retail and wholesaledistribution channels each distribution channel could then be further split into food and non-food divisions.

            Batch management requirement indicator  
            Specifies whether the material is managed in batches.  
            This indicator can be set in the material master record manually or, if batches are valuated individually, it is set automatically for the plants concerned, in which case it cannot be changed.  
            The indicator cannot be changed if stocks exist in either the current period or in the previous period. The reason for checking the previous period is because stocks can be posted to this period when goods movements are entered.
        BatchRecReq:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          title: Batch rec. req.
          description: |-
            Approved Batch Record Required  
            You use this indicator to specify that the following activities may only be performed after the relevant batch record has been approved:  
            Making the usage decision for an inspection lot of the origin Goods receipt from production  
            Changing the batch status from Restricted to Unrestricted  
            This indicator is only taken into account for batches that have been manufactured using a process order.  
            We recommend using an order type for which the Batch record required indicator has been set in Customizing to produce materials for which this indicator has been set.

            Product allocation determination procedure  
            The product allocation determination procedure determines how product allocation is carried out.  
            The product allocation determination procedure should be entered in the basic data screen in the material master record.  
            Certain allocations to the product allocation determination procedure strongly influence how product allocations can be created with the application menu:  
            You assign an info structure to the product allocation determination procedure. This info structure influences which criteria are used when product allocations are stored in the planning hierarchy.  
            You can assign several objects to the product allocation determination procedure. Each object has its own validity period. On the basis of the delivery date in the order, the system determines the relevant object. The system then uses this object to determine the corresponding planning hierarchy which contains product allocations.
        AssignEffVals:

            Assign effectivity parameter values/ override change numbers  
            Indicates whether you can assign values to the effectivity parameters or override the date, when you explode an assembly or a finished product.  
            If you set the indicator, the following applies:  
            If you only use date validity, you can override the date that the system uses to determine the components. To do this, you set certain change numbers as valid or invalid.  
            If you use parameter effectivity, you can assign values to the effectivity parameters. As well as this you can set certain change numbers to valid or invalid and thus override the parameter variant (the values you previously assigned).
        Configurable:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          title: Configurable
          description: |-
            Configurable Material  
            Indicator that determines whether the material is configurable.  
            If this indicator is set, you can assign a variant class to the material, making it possible to use it as a configurable material.  
            This indicator can be set in one of the following ways:  
            Manually in the material master record, irrespective of the material type  
            In Customizing for the Material Master in the activity Define Attributes of Material Types  
            In this case, the indicator is set automatically whenever you create a material of the corresponding material type. It is not possible to cancel the indicator manually in the material master record.
        EnvtRelevant:

            Environmentally Relevant  
            Specifies that this is an environmentally relevant material.  
            When you save a delivery in the SAP component Sales and Distribution (SD), the system checks whether the delivery contains a material for which the Environmentally relevant indicator is set. If it does, an output of output type SDB is selected via an SD condition schema. The output selected is used to forward the data for the delivery (material, recipient, sales organization, and so on) to the Product Safety component, where additional checks and functions are triggered.  
            A report is shipped automatically if  
            the environmentally relevant material is assigned to a substance  
            this substance is subject to a material safety data sheet in the jurisdiction to which the recipient is in turn subject  
            Customizing for Product Safety is configured accordingly under Report Shipping and the system can select a suitable report.

        BaseUnit:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 3
          title: Base Unit
          description: |-
            Base Unit of Measure  
            Unit of measure in which stocks of the material are managed. The system converts all the quantities you enter in other units of measure (alternative units of measure) to the base unit of measure.  
            You define the base unit of measure and also alternative units of measure and their conversion factors in the material master record.  
            Since all data is updated in the base unit of measure, your entry is particularly important for the conversion of alternative units of measure. A quantity in the alternative unit of measure can only be shown precisely if its value can be shown with the decimal places available. To ensure this, please note the following:  
            The base unit of measure is the unit satisfying the highest necessary requirement for precision.  
            The conversion of alternative units of measure to the base unit should result in simple decimal fractions (not, for example, 1/3 = 0.333...).  
            Inventory Management  
            In Inventory Management, the base unit of measure is the same as the stockkeeping unit.  
            Services  
            Services have units of measure of their own, including the following:  
            Service unit  
            Unit of measure at the higher item level. The precise quantities of the individual services are each at the detailed service line level.  
            Blanket

            Materials management (for example, in purchasing and in inventory management)  
            Production planning and control  
            Plant maintenance  
            Warehouse management  
            Costing with a quantity structure  
            The cross-plant material status restricts the usability of the material for all plants, that is, it defines whether a warning or error message is displayed if you include the material in a particular function.  
            The material may be a part under development or one to be discontinued.
        ValidFrom:
          type: string

          description: |-
            Date from which the cross-plant material status is valid  
            Materials planning  
            The valid-from date of the material status is considered only if it precedes or is the same as the planning date; that is, if the valid-from date is later than the planning date, it is not considered, even if it is within the planning horizon.  
            Example  
                  I<-------------Planning horizon------------->I  
             -----I--------------------I-----------------------I-->  
                Planning date        Valid-from date          Time  
            In this case, the valid-from date is not considered in materials planning since it is later than the planning date.  
            Purchasing  
            The valid-from date of the material status is checked against the current date.  
            Example  
            You block the material for purchasing from May 1, xxxx. A purchase order is created for the material on April 28, xxxx with a delivery date of May 10, xxxx. In this case, the valid-from date May 1, xxxx is checked against the purchase order date April 28, xxxx and the purchase order is allowed. Had you created the purchase order on May 3, xxxx, an error message would have been issued.

          description: |-
            General item category group  
            Materials grouping that helps the system to determine item categories during sales document processing.  
            If a group is configured specific to distribution channel, it has priority if the corresponding activity is distribution channel-dependent.  
            The system automatically suggests an item type in the document depending on the item category group you assign and the sales document type you are processing.  
            In the standard system, there are normal items, items that signify services (and therefore need no delivery processing) and items that signify packing material, for example.

            If you now create a packing instruction containing the reference material 4711 as an item of item type "R", both material 4711-01 and material 4711-02 can be packed automatically using this packing instruction.

          description: |-
            Level of Explicitness for Serial Number  
            Level on which the serial number must be unique.  
            If the indicator is blank, then only the combination of the material- and serial number is unique.  
            If the indicator is 1, the serial number and equipment number are kept synchronous; that is, when master records are created, the system always sets the equipment number the same as the serial number.  
            In this way you can make the serial numbers unique on a client-wide scale. A prerequisite for this is that all material master records have the indicator set to 1.  
            This indicator is plant wide, that is, the setting applies to all the plants of the corresponding material master record.
        Division:
          type: string
          nullable: true
          maxLength: 2
          title: Division
          description: |-
            A way of grouping materials, products, or services. The system uses divisions to determine the sales areas and the business areas for a material, product, or service.  
            A product or service is always assigned to just one division. From the point of view of sales and distribution, the use of divisions lets you organize your sales structure around groups of similar products or product lines. This allows the people in a division who process orders and service customers to specialize within a manageable area of expertise.  
            If a sales organization sells food and non-food products through both retail and wholesaledistribution channels each distribution channel could then be further split into food and non-food divisions.

            Basic Material  
            Basic constituent of the material.  
            When you maintain a material master record, any basic material that you specify on the Basic Data screen in the standard R/3 System is checked against a table of basic materials that you can specify in Customizing. For more information, see the documentation for the activity Define basic materials in Customizing for the Material Master.

          description: |-
            Batch management requirement indicator  
            Specifies whether the material is managed in batches.  
            This indicator can be set in the material master record manually or, if batches are valuated individually, it is set automatically for the plants concerned, in which case it cannot be changed.  
            The indicator cannot be changed if stocks exist in either the current period or in the previous period. The reason for checking the previous period is because stocks can be posted to this period when goods movements are entered.
        BatchRecReq:
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          title: Batch rec. req.
          description: |-
            Approved Batch Record Required  
            You use this indicator to specify that the following activities may only be performed after the relevant batch record has been approved:  
            Making the usage decision for an inspection lot of the origin Goods receipt from production  
            Changing the batch status from Restricted to Unrestricted  
            This indicator is only taken into account for batches that have been manufactured using a process order.  
            We recommend using an order type for which the Batch record required indicator has been set in Customizing to produce materials for which this indicator has been set.

            Production planning and control  
            Quality management  
            Plant maintenance  
            Warehouse management  
            Costing with a quantity structure  
            The material status restricts the usability of the material, that is, it defines whether a warning or an error message is displayed if you include the material in a particular function.  
            You can assign a material status to a material at the following levels:  
            Plant level  
            Cross-plant level (that is, at client level)  
            The material may be a part under development or one to be discontinued.
